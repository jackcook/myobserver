## Our Story
Google Street View is a fun way to explore the world through the comfort of your own room. With our app, MyObserver, users are immersed in the streets of Google Maps and are given the ability to visit places without actually going there! We created a simple yet useful app that adds a new dimension to the traditional use of Google Street View.

MyObserver is an iOS app that allows users to interact with Google Street View using Google Cardboard. The user can also zoom in and out using a Myo device.

## Myo Controls
- **Zoom In**: Rotate arm clockwise
- **Zoom Out**: Rotate arm counter-clockwise
